### This directory contains the STL files for fabiracation (3D Printing) of the Prosthetic Arm.
[Reference](https://www.viralsciencecreativity.com/post/arduino-flex-sensor-controlled-robot-hand)

We 3D printed all the parts with 10% infill density.
All the printed parts were assembled using elastic strings and cords as shown in the final prototype.
