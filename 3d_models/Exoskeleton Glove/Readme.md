### This directory contains the STL files for fabiracation (3D Printing) of the Exoskeleton Glove.
All parts have been manufactured at 50% infill density for higher strength due to delicate parts. It is advised to use normal supports with brim (outer only) so that all parts get manufactured accurately, especially the smaller complex parts

1. Connect 1, Connect 2 connect base at attached using a hinge to propogate the joint angles accurately to the rotary potentiometer.
2. Index Sensor place 1 velcro v12 features a slide locking mechanism for the rotary encoder avoiding press-fit mechanism due recurrent failure and breakage. We have assembled the sensing glove using velcro to make it compatible for any arm size.
3. sensor body attachment v14, sensor body attachment base, sensor body attachment back, and palm base constitute the components fixed on the back side of the palm. The assembly of sensor body attachment v14, sensor body attachment base, sensor body attachment back helps achieve a 2 DOF sensing of motion in the lateral and transverse plane.
4. pcb case easy v1 and pcb case top v1 are rhe enclosures for PCB with slots for wires
