In a nutshell, our design collects data from rotary potentiometers serially, sends them to Rpi pico which in turn quickly cycles through the available channels in a round robin fashion while powering everything using an LM2596 Buck converter

Our PCB design has the ability to support upto 24 rotary potentiometers due to which we have 24 ports connected to ground and 24 ports connected to VCC(3.3V output from sensor). We connected these to the 3.3v supply of Pico instead of our main power supply which is LM2596 because cd74hc4067 multiplexers are designed to take an input between 0 and 3.3V.
External power is inputted at the 2x1 connector which is also the input of out LM2596 buck converter, the output of this converter powers both our cd74hc multiplexers. Raspberry pico runs a program in which it outputs different values periodically at 4 different GPIO pins(2,3,4,5) which are connected to s0,s1,s2,s3 of multiplexer 1 and GPIO pins(18,19,20,21) which are connected to s0,s1,s2,s3 of multiplexer 2. The output of each of the multiplexers(sig) is connected to 2 out of 3 ADC pins in rpi pico(GPIO 26,27,28). This output is transmitted to unity and esp32 which controls the prosthetic arm
